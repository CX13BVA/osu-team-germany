- Diff range: Kantan - Oni

If it’s a fun set (not for rank): Disregard the above and send it!

In order to request a [b]GD[/b] post the request below using the following:
- For rank or not:
- Artist & Title:
- What diff you’re requesting:
- Link to the mapset:
And if possible, at what time do you expect it to be finished?

Note: The "For rank or not" question lets me determine the priority, as rank requests go over loved/graveyard ones.
Note: I will add the set to my osumod queue as a reminder for myself.

This post will be edited as I see the need to do so, even if it’s just to add a dot at the end of a sentence.
